Welcome to an Intelligent Traffic Management System! Tackling urban congestion head-on, this project focuses on a four-road junction, employing a dynamic traffic management system to minimize congestion, prioritize emergency vehicles like ambulances, enhance overall efficiency, and ensure safety. With a user-friendly interface built on Visual Studio and Python, the system utilizes Pygame for graphics, providing a real-time simulation of vehicle movement and signal control. The codebase includes modules for cars, signals, and essential functions, creating a seamless experience. Feel free to contribute, and  optimize urban traffic together! #TrafficOptimization #SmartCity #Python #UrbanMobility
